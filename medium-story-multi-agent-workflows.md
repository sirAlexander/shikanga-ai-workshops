# I Built a Multi-Agent AI System That Writes Full-Stack Apps â€” Here's What I Learned

## How I turned OpenAI's Agents SDK and Codex CLI into a production-ready workflow that generates complete applications autonomously

![A conceptual banner image would go here]

---

**TL;DR:** I created a multi-agent AI system where a Project Manager, Designer, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, and Tester collaborate autonomously to build complete applications. The agents use gated handoffs, write real code via Codex MCP, and produce traceable, repeatable workflows. In this article, I'll show you exactly how I did it â€” step by step.

## The Problem: AI Agents Are Powerful, But Chaotic

If you've experimented with AI code generation, you know the feeling: the demos look incredible, but when you try to build something real, chaos ensues.

**The typical experience:**
- Agents hallucinate files that don't exist
- Multiple agents overwrite each other's work
- No clear handoff points between tasks
- Zero visibility into what went wrong
- Impossible to reproduce results

I wanted something different. I wanted **predictable, traceable, production-ready workflows** where AI agents collaborate like a real software team.

So I built it.

---

## What I Built: A Multi-Agent Development Team

Imagine this: you give a high-level task to an AI Project Manager, and it orchestrates an entire team of specialist agents:

1. **Project Manager** â€” breaks down requirements into actionable specs
2. **Designer** â€” creates UI/UX specifications and wireframes
3. **Frontend Developer** â€” implements the interface (HTML/CSS/JS)
4. **Backend Developer** â€” builds API endpoints (Node.js)
5. **Tester** â€” verifies everything works and writes test plans

The magic? **They actually work together** with gated handoffs, proper file structure, and complete observability.

### The Result

Starting from this simple prompt:

> "Build a tiny browser game to showcase a multi-agent workflow."

The system generates a complete "Bug Busters" game with:
- Fully functional frontend (player clicks moving bugs for points)
- Working backend API with leaderboard
- Design specifications
- Test plans
- All organized in proper folders

**No hallucinations. No overwrites. Just working code.**

---

## The Secret Sauce: Three Key Innovations

### 1. Codex CLI as an MCP Server

Instead of letting agents write files directly (chaos!), I connected them to **Codex CLI via Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

This gives agents:
- **Sandboxed file operations** (`workspace-write` mode)
- **No approval friction** (`approval-policy: never`)
- **Safe, traceable writes** to the actual filesystem

```python
async with MCPServerStdio(
    name="Codex CLI",
    params={"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "codex", "mcp"]},
    client_session_timeout_seconds=360000,
) as codex_mcp_server:
    # Agents connect here
```

Now every file write is logged, sandboxed, and repeatable.

### 2. Gated Handoffs

This was the game-changer. **Agents can't proceed until required artifacts exist.**

The Project Manager orchestrates like this:

```
PM creates â†’ REQUIREMENTS.md, AGENT_TASKS.md, TEST.md
    â†“
PM waits for all three files to exist
    â†“
PM hands off to Designer
    â†“
PM waits for design_spec.md to exist
    â†“
PM hands off to Frontend & Backend IN PARALLEL
    â†“
PM waits for index.html AND server.js to exist
    â†“
PM hands off to Tester
```

No agent jumps the gun. No missing dependencies. Clean, linear progression.

### 3. Observable Traces

Every action is visible in the **OpenAI Traces dashboard**:
- Prompts sent to each agent
- MCP tool calls to Codex
- Handoff decisions
- File writes
- Timing breakdowns

When something goes wrong, you can pinpoint exactly where and why.

## The Journey: From Single Agent to Multi-Agent Orchestration

### Phase 1: Single-Agent Proof of Concept

I started simple:

- **Designer agent** creates a game concept (3-sentence brief)
- **Developer agent** receives the brief and generates `index.html`

This proved the MCP connection worked and agents could collaborate via handoffs.

**Result:** A playable browser game in ~50 lines of HTML/CSS/JS.

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent with Parallel Execution

Then I scaled up:

- Added **Project Manager** to create formal specs
- Split development into **Frontend** and **Backend** (running in parallel!)
- Added **Tester** for validation
- Implemented gated handoffs

**Result:** A complete full-stack application with:
```
codex-workflows/
â”œâ”€â”€ REQUIREMENTS.md
â”œâ”€â”€ AGENT_TASKS.md
â”œâ”€â”€ TEST.md
â”œâ”€â”€ design/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ design_spec.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ wireframe.md
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ game.js
â””â”€â”€ backend/
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
    â””â”€â”€ server.js
```

## What I Learned: Key Insights

### 1. Constraints Enable Creativity

Limiting agents to **only read specific files** (REQUIREMENTS.md, AGENT_TASKS.md) forced them to be precise. No assumptions, no hallucinations.

```python
instructions=(
    "Your only source of truth is AGENT_TASKS.md and REQUIREMENTS.md.\n"
    "Do not assume anything not written there."
)
```

### 2. Explicit Instructions Are Everything

Vague prompts = chaos. Specific deliverables = success.

**Bad:**
```python
"You are a frontend developer."
```

**Good:**
```python
"Deliverables (write to /frontend):\n"
"- index.html\n"
"- styles.css (or inline)\n"
"- game.js (or main.js)\n\n"
"Follow the Designer's DOM structure; no extra features."
```

### 3. The PM Agent Is the Orchestration Layer

Don't scatter orchestration logic. **One agent controls the workflow.**

The Project Manager:
- Creates all coordination documents
- Gates all handoffs
- Verifies artifacts before proceeding
- Uses reasoning to make decisions (`reasoning=Reasoning(effort="medium")`)

### 4. Parallel Execution Saves Time

Frontend and Backend can run **simultaneously** since they don't depend on each other â€” only on the Designer's output.

This cut execution time nearly in half.

### 5. Traceability Is Non-Negotiable

Without traces, debugging multi-agent systems is impossible. The OpenAI dashboard shows:
- Which agent made which decision
- When handoffs occurred
- What MCP calls were made
- Execution timings

This visibility makes these systems **actually usable in production**.

## The Tech Stack

Here's what powers this system:

- **OpenAI Agents SDK** â€” agent orchestration and handoffs
- **Codex CLI** â€” file operations via MCP
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** â€” standardized tool interface
- **Python 3.10+** â€” runtime environment
- **OpenAI API** â€” LLM inference (GPT-4o, GPT-5)

All running locally on your machine. No complex cloud setup required.
