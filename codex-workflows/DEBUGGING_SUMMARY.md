# Multi-Agent Workflow Debugging Summary

## Issue
The multi-agent workflow (Step 5 of the tutorial) exits prematurely after the Project Manager creates the three root files (REQUIREMENTS.md, TEST.md, AGENT_TASKS.md). The Designer, Frontend, Backend, and Tester agents never execute.

## What We Tried

### 1. Increased `max_turns` from 30 to 100
- **Result**: Still exits at the same point
- **Conclusion**: The issue is not related to turn limits

### 2. Added Comprehensive Logging
- Created `multi_agent_workflow_with_logging.py` with detailed logging
- Logs saved to `workflow_execution.log`
- **Result**: Confirmed PM completes its task but handoff doesn't trigger continuation

### 3. Verified MCP Connection
- Codex MCP server connects successfully
- All agents are created properly
- **Result**: Infrastructure is working correctly

## Root Cause Analysis

The workflow stops because:

1. **The PM's final message says**: "Next, the Designer will produce /design/design_spec.md and a wireframe"
2. **But no actual handoff occurs**: The `transfer_to_designer` function is never called
3. **The workflow terminates** instead of continuing to the Designer agent

This suggests the PM agent is **describing** what should happen next rather than **executing** the handoff.

## Why This Happens

The OpenAI Agents SDK with `Runner.run()` appears to have a behavior where:
- When an agent completes its immediate task, it may return control
- The agent might need more explicit instructions to **call the handoff function**
- The gating logic in the PM instructions might be too abstract

## Potential Solutions

### Option 1: Simplify PM Instructions (Recommended)
Make the PM's instructions more action-oriented:

```python
instructions=(
    f"""{RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX}"""
    """
    You are the Project Manager.

    Your task:
    1. Create these three files in the project root:
       - REQUIREMENTS.md
       - TEST.md
       - AGENT_TASKS.md
    2. IMMEDIATELY after creating them, call transfer_to_designer()

    Do NOT just describe what will happen - actually call the transfer function.
    """
)
```

### Option 2: Remove Gating Logic
The complex gating instructions might confuse the model. Consider:
- Removing file existence checks from PM
- Having each agent automatically hand off when done
- Moving gating logic to a separate orchestration layer

### Option 3: Use Continue Pattern
Instead of relying on automatic handoffs, manually continue the workflow:

```python
# After PM completes
pm_result = await Runner.run(project_manager, task_list, max_turns=10)

# Manually trigger Designer
designer_result = await Runner.run(designer, "Read REQUIREMENTS.md and AGENT_TASKS.md and create your design", max_turns=15)

# Continue pattern for each agent...
```

### Option 4: Increase Model Reasoning
The PM uses `reasoning=Reasoning(effort="medium")`. Try:
- `effort="high"` for more thorough planning
- Or remove reasoning parameter entirely to see if it helps

## Current State

### Files Created ✅
- `/codex-workflows/REQUIREMENTS.md` (5.2KB)
- `/codex-workflows/TEST.md` (2.4KB)
- `/codex-workflows/AGENT_TASKS.md` (3.7KB)

### Files NOT Created ❌
- `/design/design_spec.md`
- `/frontend/index.html`, `/frontend/styles.css`, `/frontend/app.js`
- `/backend/server.js`
- `/tests/test_plan.md`, `/tests/verify.sh`

## Logs and Outputs

- **Main log**: `workflow_execution.log` (5.6MB)
- **Console output**: `workflow_run_output.txt` (2.6MB)
- **Test script**: `multi_agent_workflow_with_logging.py`

## Next Steps

1. **Try Option 1**: Simplify PM instructions to be more imperative
2. **Test handoffs explicitly**: Create a minimal 2-agent test (PM → Designer only)
3. **Check OpenAI Agents SDK docs**: Look for examples of gated multi-agent workflows
4. **Consider filing issue**: This might be a limitation/bug in the Agents SDK

## Additional Notes

- The Codex MCP integration works correctly
- File writing via Codex succeeds
- The issue is specifically with agent-to-agent handoffs
- All validation warnings in logs are harmless (Codex event format mismatch)
